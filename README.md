# React Album CRUD App
This is a simple React app that demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with an API. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete albums using the JSONPlaceholder API.

### Installation
To run this app locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/shubh9752/react-album-crud-app.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd react-album-crud-app

Install dependencies: npm install

Start the app: npm start

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

### Usage
The app has a simple interface that allows users to:

Add a new album by entering the title and clicking the "Add Album" button.\

Edit an existing album by clicking the "Edit" button and entering a new title.\

Delete an album by clicking the "Delete" button.\

All data is stored on the JSONPlaceholder API, so any changes made to the albums will be reflected in the API.

### Technologies Used
React \
Axios

### Acknowledgments
This app was created as part of a tutorial on CRUD operations with React and APIs. Special thanks to the JSONPlaceholder team for providing a simple API for testing purposes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
